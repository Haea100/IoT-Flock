# IoT-Flock #
IoT-Flock is an open-source tool for IoT traffic generation which supports the two widely used IoT
application layer protocols, i.e., MQTT and CoAP. IoT-Flock allows a user to create an IoT use case,
add customized IoT devices into it and generate normal and malicious IoT traffic over a real-time
network.

# Uses #
* IoT-Flock allows a user to generate the detailed custom packets.
* IoT-Flock can also be used in stress testing of different IoT-based network utilities like switches, routers, etc., by generating a large amount of IoT device traffic.
* It can be used for the designing and testing of IoT security providing entities like IDS, IPS, etc.
* IoT-Flock can help the researchers in IoT Security Research. The researchers can easily build their own use case, model IoT devices into it and then generate & analyse the traffic of the use case in order to develop better security solutions for IoT.
* The Network Engineers can use IoT-Flock for benchmarking the network features and to troubleshoot the network problems.

# IoT Attacks included in IoT-Flock #
Currently, we included four recent IoT application layer vulnerability attacks in the IoT-Flock:
